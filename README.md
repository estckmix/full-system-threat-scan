Checks the Windows system logs for detected threats and emails reports.

Full System Scan Implementation

Overview

This document outlines the steps to automate security tasks, including scheduling full-system scans, enabling real-time protection, configuring Windows Task Scheduler to run scans every 12 hours, and emailing scan logs to the security team. These steps will ensure continuous protection and monitoring of security threats.
________________________________________

1. PowerShell Script Functionality

This PowerShell script performs the following security tasks:

â€¢	Enables Windows Defender Real-Time Protection to ensure active monitoring.

â€¢	Schedules a full-system scan at a predefined interval (every 12 hours).

â€¢	Logs scan results and captures detected threats.

â€¢	Emails scan logs using Outlookâ€™s SMTP server to the security team.

âš Security Considerations

âš  Avoid storing plaintext passwords in scripts. Instead, use PowerShellâ€™s SecureString for safer password handling.

âš  If you prefer to schedule the job through Task Scheduler comment out the Daily Scan Task code. Then follow the below instructions. âš
